Description: Filter which fuses angular velocities, accelerations, and (optionally) magnetic readings from a generic IMU device into a quaternion to represent the orientation of the device wrt the global frame.
 Based on the algorithm by Roberto G. Valenti etal. described in the paper &quot;Keeping a Good Attitude: A Quaternion-Based Orientation Filter for IMUs and MARGs&quot; available at http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/15/8/19302 .
